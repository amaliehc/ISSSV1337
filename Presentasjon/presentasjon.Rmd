## <br> Phase 1 – how to harvest and analyze the data?
- A webcrawler that could collect data across different websites? <br> This would be too difficult and it would only work with some organizations
- A code that could read PDF? <br> 


## <br> Phase 2 – Exploring three options
- Financial statements in yearly reports published as PDF <br>
Issue: Financial statements are not always published as text
- Webscraping financial statements from Proff.no <br>
Issue: Proff.no does not allow webscraping!
- Webscraping the Brønnøysund registry <br>
Issue: The registry does offer API access, but access costs about 500k kr

## <br> Workarounds... 
- Proff.no: It maaay be legal to manually download the websites as HTML instead of scraping 
- Brønnøysund: We attempted to request a temporary access to XML documents

## <br> ... and why they did not work
- Different accounting divisions at Proff.no and Brønnøysund prohibited extracting the correct sums  OPX wanted
- Not all NGOs publish their financial statements and certainly not for every year
- **Which led us to Phase 3 - scrapping the scraping**

## <br> Our experience
- Unsolvable case due to non-existent data
- Hard to create credible KPIs due to limited knowledge of economics and the NGO sector
- **Insight into real-life work challenges - the clash between what is desired and what is possible**
