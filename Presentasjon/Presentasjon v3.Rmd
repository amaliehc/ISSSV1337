```


## <br> How to assess financial performance?
- Data collection 
- Key Performance Indicators <br>

```

## <br> Phase 1 – how to harvest and analyze the data?
- OPX wanted us to harvest data --> how? <br> 
- A webcrawler? <br> 
No: Would not work for every organization 
- A code that could read PDF? <br> 
Perhaps: Financial statements as text tables and as images


## <br> Phase 2 – Exploring three options
- 1. Reading PDFs <br>
Issue: Not always published as text
- 2. Webscraping from Proff.no <br>
Issue: Proff.no does not allow webscraping
- 3. Webscraping the Brønnøysund registry <br>
Issue: No API access, and access costs ~ kr 500K

## <br> Workarounds... 
- Proff.no: Download HTML?
- Brønnøysund: Request temporary access

## <br> ... and why they did not work
- Different accounting items used
- Incomplete financial reporting from NGOs

```

## <br> Which led us to Phase 3 – Scrapping the scraping
- OPX wanted KPIs
- Found useful KPIs
- Created an interactive dashboard

## <br> Data collection & data description
- Used data from OPX and Proff.no 
- OPX: From their webpage
- Used to create KPIs and check our codes
- Proff.no: Downloaded HTML documents
- Used to create visualizations

## <br> Our experience
- Unsolvable case due to non-existent data
- Hard to create credible KPIs due to limited knowledge of economics and the NGO sector
- **Insight into real-life work challenges - the clash between what is desired and what is possible**
